# Machine Learning Algorithms for Analysis and Market Segmentation

This repository contains the entire process to implement the best algorithm for segment users
and make targeted campaigns in the context of a
mobile application *Clipp* and its **Events** section particularly.

## Testing Datasets

The first step that we aplied was to implement a clustering algorithm over two e-commerce datasets obtained at *Kaggle* to make us an idea of how we need to work with this type of information.
